SCRIPTS DRAFT OVERVIEW:
Opening:
Levi is introduced as the most popular guy at his college, with a montage of him playing football, partying, and hooking up with girls.
Inciting Incident:
Levi makes fun of a fat, unattractive girl in front of his friends, not realizing she is a witch. She puts a spell on him and the next morning, he wakes up as an ugly version of himself. He's horrified and tries to cover up his appearance with hats and sunglasses, but soon realizes he can't hide from the world forever.
Act 2:
Levi's friends and teammates don't recognize him and start to bully him. He's no longer the star player on the football team and girls don't pay attention to him anymore. He's forced to confront how his actions have hurt others and begin to see the value of inner beauty.
Love Story:
Levi meets a girl who is blind and doesn't care about his appearance. They bond over shared interests and values, and Levi learns to appreciate her for who she is, not just her disability.
Midpoint:
Levi discovers the witch who cursed him and tries to convince her to lift the spell. She tells him that the only way to lift the spell is for him to prove that he has truly changed and learned his lesson. The witch tells him that he needs to complete a set of challenging tasks to prove his worth.
Act 3:
Levi embarks on a journey of self-improvement, both physically and mentally. He starts by volunteering at a homeless shelter, where he meets people who have struggled with their own appearance and learns to be more empathetic. He also starts working out and eating healthy, determined to get back in shape and become a better football player.
Climax:
Levi organizes a charity event to raise money for a children's hospital, which showcases his new-found inner beauty. His friends and teammates see how much he's changed and are inspired by his transformation. However, the witch appears and tells Levi that he still hasn't completed all of the tasks she set for him.
Resolution:
Levi realizes that the final task is to apologize to the girl he made fun of and ask for her forgiveness. He does so, and she tells him that she forgives him but that he still has a long way to go in making amends for his past behavior. The witch is impressed by Levi's efforts and lifts the curse. Levi's appearance goes back to normal, but he's changed on the inside, and his newfound kindness and empathy make him more attractive than ever. He reconciles with the girl he made fun of and starts a relationship with the blind girl, showing that true beauty is not just skin deep. The movie ends with Levi playing football again, this time with a newfound appreciation for his physical abilities and a desire to keep up his healthy habits.
Overall, this updated plotline emphasizes the importance of personal growth and self-improvement, as well as the complexity of making amends for past mistakes. The protagonist's journey is more challenging and fulfilling, and the lifting of the curse is a result of his own efforts rather than simply following instructions from the witch.
