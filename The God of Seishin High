Takumi, a meek and unassuming high school student, is walking down a deserted street on his way home from school.

Suddenly, a group of four menacing-looking delinquents emerge from an alleyway and block his path.

The delinquents demand Takumi's lunch money, but he explains that he doesn't have any.

As Takumi's classmates continue to jeer at him, he feels his temper rising, his heart pounding in his chest. He's had enough of being pushed around and bullied, but he knows he can't fight back - not with the numbers stacked against him.

One of the thugs grabs Takumi by the collar and shoves him against the wall, sneering in his face. "Where's our money, huh?" he demands.

Takumi grits his teeth, his fists clenching at his sides. He knows he doesn't have the money - not this time. "I don't have it," he mutters, his voice shaking slightly.

The thug's grip tightens, and he draws a blade from his pocket, holding it up to Takumi's face. "You know what happens to people who don't pay up, right?" he snarls.

Takumi stares at the blade, his mind racing. He's never been in a fight before, never stood up for himself. But something inside him snaps, and he feels a surge of rage coursing through his veins.

Without thinking, he lashes out, sinking his teeth into the thug's hand. The thug recoils in pain, and his friends laugh and jeer at him.

But Takumi isn't finished yet. He shoves the thug away from him and snatches up a nearby metal chair, swinging it at his attackers with all his might.

The thugs are caught off guard by Takumi's sudden burst of violence, and they're unable to defend themselves as he pummels them with the chair.

When Takumi comes back to himself, he's panting and covered in sweat, the chair bent and twisted in his hand. The thugs are lying on the ground, groaning in pain.

As the school bell rings and students begin to file out of the classroom, Takumi stands there, breathing heavily, unsure of what to do next. He knows that he's just crossed a line, that he's done something he can't take back.

But he also knows that he's just proven something to himself - that he's not as weak as he thought he was, that he's capable of standing up for himself when he needs to. And he knows that he's just set himself on a path that will lead to even greater challenges - and even greater victories.

--- Takumi pespective:
Takumi feels a seething anger bubbling inside of him. He is trembling, but not in fear, it's pure rage. They have gone too far this time. Why do they keep bullying him? What has he ever done to them? Takumi can't take it anymore.

Suddenly, everything turns red. His vision, his thoughts, his very being. He feels his body moving on its own, like he's outside of himself, watching a violent frenzy take hold. Takumi loses consciousness, but his body keeps moving, punching, kicking, and throwing his attackers to the ground.

When he comes back to his senses, he's panting and sweating, surrounded by the beaten bodies of the thugs. Takumi can barely believe what just happened, but he knows that he can never go back to being the weak kid who gets bullied. From now on, he will fight back and defend himself, no matter what it takes.
