Title: "Davie Who?"
Description: Davie has always been invisible to the world, but that all changes when a wish magically transforms him into the most famous person on the planet. As he grapples with his newfound celebrity, Davie must decide if this is the life he truly wants or if he'd rather go back to being anonymous.

FADE IN:

EXT. QUIET SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

DAVIE, a young man in his mid-twenties, walks alone down the street. He looks down at his phone, scrolling through a dating app with no luck. He sighs and puts his phone away, continuing on his way.

DAVIE (to himself)
"If only people would notice me and care about me..."

Suddenly, a bright light shines in his face. He shields his eyes and looks up to see a group of paparazzi running towards him.

PAPARAZZI #1
"Davie! Davie! Over here!"

DAVIE (confused)
"What? Who's Davie?"

PAPARAZZI #2
"The most popular guy on the planet, that's who!"

DAVIE (shocked)
"What? How is that possible?"

PAPARAZZI #3
"We don't know, but everyone knows you now! You're a superstar!"

Davie tries to run away, but the paparazzi chase after him. People on the street stop and stare, pointing at him.

RANDOM PERSON #1
"Look, it's Davie!"

RANDOM PERSON #2
"I can't believe it! Davie is here!"

DAVIE (to himself)
"What is happening to me?"

CUT TO:

INT. DAVIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Davie sits in front of his TV, flipping through channels. Every channel is about him. The news, talk shows, reality TV, even the weather.

DAVIE (to himself)
"This is insane. How did I become famous overnight?"

Suddenly, there's a knock at his door. He opens it to find a group of fans waiting outside.

FAN #1
"Oh my god, it's Davie! Can we get a picture with you?"

DAVIE (overwhelmed)
"Uh, sure..."

The fans take selfies with Davie, hugging him and praising him. Davie is confused and uncomfortable, but he can't deny the attention feels good.

CUT TO:

INT. DAVIE'S WORKPLACE - DAY

Davie sits at his desk, trying to work, but his coworkers keep interrupting him.

COWORKER #1
"Hey Davie, can I get your autograph?"

COWORKER #2
"I can't believe I'm working with a celebrity!"

Davie tries to ignore them and focus on his work, but it's impossible.

CUT TO:

INT. DAVIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Davie sits alone on his couch, staring at the TV. He flips through channels, but every show is about him. He sighs and turns off the TV.

DAVIE (to himself)
"I thought I wanted people to notice me, but this is too much. I just want my old life back."

--- Ending Idea:

As Davie stands in front of his house, he looks back at the crowd of people who had followed him all day. He takes a deep breath and whispers to himself, "I don't need this anymore."

Suddenly, a bright light engulfs Davie, and he feels a strange sensation in his body. When the light dissipates, Davie looks around and realizes that he is alone. No paparazzi, no fans, no attention.

He walks towards his house, feeling relieved but also a little sad that he's back to his old, unnoticed life. As he approaches his front door, he hears a voice from behind.

"Hi Davie," it's his neighbor, Mrs. Johnson. She smiles at him and goes inside her house.

Davie stares at her for a moment, feeling confused. How does she know his name?

Suddenly, he realizes that he's wearing a name tag with the word "Davie" on it. He chuckles to himself, feeling silly for forgetting about it.

He takes off the name tag and tosses it in the trash. As he opens his front door, he realizes that things are different now. He may not be the center of attention anymore, but he knows that he doesn't need to be. He's content with who he is and the people who truly care about him.

Davie walks inside his house, feeling happy and fulfilled. He smiles to himself, knowing that he doesn't need fame or attention to feel important. He's just Davie, and that's enough.

Cut to: Davie alone in his room, scrolling through social media. He has no matches on dating apps, no new notifications on Facebook, and no one has even liked his latest Instagram post.

Cut to: Davie's family watching him on TV. They're all amazed and proud of him, but they still don't seem to notice him as a person. His mother turns to his sister and says, "I can't believe our Davie is famous now!" His sister replies, "Who?"

The camera lingers on the empty street, as the sounds of the paparazzi fade away.
